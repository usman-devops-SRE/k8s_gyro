    <p text style="text-align:left";> <font size ="5">Gyro Cafe is our very popular mediteranean restaurant. We are<br/> known for our one of a kind Lamb gyro and Chicken Gyro which <br/>can be served in a pita bread sandwich, naan, or over rice with salad<br/> toppings of your choice. Our first location did so well, that we <br/>decided to open another Gyro Cafe location. Gyro Cafe fits right in<br/> with the diversity of Ditmas Park. Plenty of different kinds of food<br/> from different cultures. Gyro Cafe introduces one of the many <br/>food cultures of the middle east to Brooklyn. To spread the taste of<br/> the middle east to Staten Island, we opened Shawafel House in the <br/>beautiful neighborhood of Elm Park. We serve our famous gyro, and <br/>added falafel to the menu which can be served in a sandwich, or over<br/> rice.
